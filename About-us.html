student at RMIT university. I
love playing basketball, I played for my secondary and high school basketball
team and I am quite proud of myself that I got 3 golds and 2 silvers. I used to
practice basketball 5 hours per day when I was in grade 10, but for now, I do
not have that much time anymore, so I try to play basketball twice a week. The
journey to my interest in IT is a long one but the most affective factor makes
me interested in that is the Intro to Computer Class I studied when I was in
Grade 12. And another reason, I chose RMIT to study more about Information and
Technology is because RMIT has a partnership with INTEL which is my dream
company I want to work in the future.&nbsp;</p>

interesting thing about me is that I am mixed of Indian, Cambodian and
Vietnamese but I literally do not understand the languages. I am fond of
playing badminton and out-door activities, it helps me improve concentration
after studying, also during free time, I spent a long time working on the Sweet
Home 3D software ​to create my brother's room plans for this year.&nbsp;I
always have that thirst for discovering and updating myself with new knowledge
on my daily basis, which makes IT a best-suited career for me as it is a continuous
learning environment. Currently,
I know a little bit about these technologies in general, basic JavaScript, CSS
and HTML, but I want to further explore and extend what I am drawn to about
them.</p>

thus, I frequently play badminton every morning Sunday with my dad. For this
reason, it is difficult for me to choose the appropriate foods for my meals. I
am quite interested in the technology because it is as useful as in the
Covid-19 pandemic. In fact, technology is the only communication tool in the
quarantine time in the world. Besides technology that will support people in
life and work in the best, developing more technology in the future will make
it easier for everyone to work, and that is what drew me to technology.
Currently my experience is being able to design a complete PowerPoint and be
able to create and store data of an application or a website.<br>

team has been working together well. We spent a lot of time to discuss and
brainstorming ideas, meanwhile everyone supported each other during project
development. Our communication was better as well as the members have
communicated more comfortable than the first weeks. Currently, we improved
effects in the game as a speed and designed the interface for the website. In
the next weeks, we will try to connect a sound for Microbit and create more Led
effect for the game. If Assignment 3 is extended, we will definitely improve
our micro: bit as much as possible since we couldn’t have done the sound
effect. We will spend more time to research about how it can be implemented and
what other micro: bit spare parts needed to support our purpose.&nbsp;</p>

            <span class="u-custom-font u-font-georgia">Phong’s dream job is become an IT project manager in ILA which I found very interesting because he has a specific company to work with. His career plan is quite common which is try his best to expand his knowledge however he showed his interest of the job clearly by researching a lot about required skills, but he still not know about the risk and the difficulty working in the company that he chooses. Bao wants to be a game tester and to do that he has to be very good at detecting bug in the code he has shown out the difficult about his job which is working with a lot of code and he need a wide knowledge about programming language. However, he still not includes the experience that he needs to get before becoming a game tester and what kind of game which its programing language most similar to him. Next, Kieu Anh have ambition to become A Big data engineering and her plan is get as much experience as possible and she want to improve her analysis skill although she has a clear plan to follow, she forgot to include the specific company and the risk of the job. My dream is to become an app developer working for Apple and my career plan is mostly like the other since I also want to expand my knowledge about programing language and making research however I usually try to read expert code to get familiar with them.</span>

            <span class="u-custom-font u-font-georgia">First of all, IT Project Manager at ILA is my dream work. For me, this role is quite appropriate because the IT project manager manages and enforces the IT systems such that the framework stably serves company operations. The IT project manager often has the duty to schedule, discipline and carry out other activities. I had a chance to work in a Canadian restaurant in a foreign business setting and have learnt some soft communication skills after grade 11. I am now learning further in order to acquire my expertise by reading computer science and IT books. Compared to my teammates’ career plan, it is quite different because my job is like gathering all those works, I will be the one who manage them. While my teammates’ career plan is only focused on a specific part of IT such as app development, game tester, my career plan is more common.</span>

            <span class="u-custom-font u-font-georgia">Big Data Engineer has always been my passion, managing the data integration practices of junior data engineering teams, and handling on-going demands for business's growing database by aiding in building optimum data pipelines. I would love to partner alongside information engineering, data analysis, monitoring and operations departments to define and execute growing techniques within the Data and Analytics Group, along with specifying the data requirements of companies by maintaining the consistency and accuracy of data obtained. Partnership with senior leadership in computer technology to leverage data with analysis and scientific methods and actively advance innovative and sophisticated technology innovation capabilities. Compared with my member’s ideal job, it seems like only Phong’s job share a number of related features to that of my job as his job also involves managing many activities simultaneously – multitasking. On the other hand, other members’ jobs do not share any similarities with my job or even related to the field and are lacked of a more detailed plan with essential goals or a clear path on how to achieve their target.</span>
