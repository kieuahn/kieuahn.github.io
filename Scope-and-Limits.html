                  <p class="u-align-justify u-custom-font u-font-georgia u-text u-text-2">After a lot of discussions, we decided to use BBC
which&nbsp; &nbsp;is a
pocket-sized codable computer with motion detection, a built-in compass and
Bluetooth technology to make this project. There are no licenses needed for
this tool. We can access it on Microbit to make code to write the code and then
we can directly download it into a micro bit. Besides, the Microbit we also
have the speaker and the micro in order to diversify options. There is one team
member in our team familiar with micro bits since he has learned and made a lot
of projects with it and it is the reason why we agree with his idea of making a
game using micro bit. Due to his experience, he has made 6 project using micro
bits in total including take a photo using micro bits, make a dice, simple
flappy bird game and so on.&nbsp;</p>

                      <span style="font-size: 0.875rem;">Many aspiring
entrepreneurs devote too much attention to the benefits of their proposals and
wrongly speak of their businesses with unrealistic ideals. So, in order to win
venture capitalists' reliability, the presenters play an extremely important
role and deeply understand the operation of Micro: bit.&nbsp;</span>
                      <br>
                      <span style="font-size: 0.875rem;">Firstly, due to our
lack of knowledge, we haven’t had many experiences with game development, all
the works we do in this project is just very basic so if we want to persuade
venture capitalists to invest, it is very important to employ a professional
game developer who is completely able to help us develop our game as the best
version of itself. The game developer should be fluent with all software
languages such as Java, Python and so on. This game developer will be also a
present who will describe about how the game was created, developed and what
tools they used to make this game. In case, the venture capitalists are IT
professor and they probably ask some questions about software stuff, the game
developer must be able to answer clearly and precisely in order to avoid risks
such as misunderstanding.&nbsp;</span>
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      <span style="font-size: 0.875rem;">Secondly, a game tester plays an indispensable role
to take our project to the next phase. They will check, indicates all the problems
of the game in order to fix. Without game testers, flaws and errors will abound
in games, potentially rendering them unplayable.&nbsp;</span>
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      <span style="font-size: 0.875rem;">Thirdly, an excellent storyteller
is extremely important because it may be the key to win the venture
capitalists’ heart. Most presentations follow a common format such as problems,
solutions, and execution plans. It's all too predictable and boring. Amazing
personal stories but cover problems and solutions. It's a way of storytelling
that can help connect presenters and listeners, and through that bond, they'll
likely gain more respect and confidence within the time allowed. Of course,
because time is limited, the story should also be brief and cover your ideas,
not wasting valuable time on stories that have nothing to do with the own ideas
and creativity.&nbsp;</span>
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      <span style="font-size: 0.875rem;">F</span>
                      <span style="font-size: 0.875rem;">inally, a marketing team contributes hugely to the success of
the project. Most venture capitalists care about the benefit of the products,
so in order to implement, marketing will help us to introduce the products,
specifically our Micro: bit game, to the customers. Through marketing, it can
increase awareness, typically people see an advertisement or get a review, they
don't immediately order or utilize the stuff. Marketing team create an audience
of prospective buyers who know who we are, know what we can give, and know just
where to find us when they are ready to purchase our game through raising
visibility. Second, through marketing, it is completely able to raise sales, if
the marketing team work efficiently, it will increase in sales shortly. And marketing
can build customers’ trust, everyone wants to buy from a respectable company.&nbsp;</span>

                    <p class="u-align-justify u-custom-font u-font-georgia u-text u-text-2">There were punches of
risk during the time we made the project. The first thing is except for members
who have experience with micro bits, the whole team has to research a lot in
order to know how micro bits work and what else can it do in order to improve
the final product. Luckily Microbit make code which is the tool we use to
create code for the game can change from Python to java and vice versa so there
not much difficult in coding the only problem was our skill in Python and Java
is not actually great, so it took a long time to finish it. There were also
have some problems with the tool such as sometimes it cannot convert Java to
Python because the convert program of the tool has problem. We still can change
Java to Python but there will appear bugs in Python code which prevent us to
convert the code again since the precise of the code is compulsory when we want
to convert into another language. Another big problem is downloading the code
to the micro bits because it usually lost connection however, we had fixed it
by replacing the cable, the same problem with the speaker we have to buy a
suitable cable to concert with the speaker. After two days using the micro
bits, we found out that one of the LEDs was broken and that what we thought at
first luckily it was not. The reason that LED did not work was the coding. We
program for the bullet shooting because the spaceship cannot reach the top left
of the micro bit it took us a day to find out, we intend to borrow another
micro bit.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

                    <p class="u-align-justify u-custom-font u-font-georgia u-text u-text-4">Communication
between members is one of the most important elements within the work of a
team. Good communication will make an effectiveness and a drive to the desired
target for the entire team. Because no one is the same, proposals can come into
a discussion regarding the desired purpose of the team. Sometimes, we meet in
areas outside of the school like a random café in District 1 in order to create
comfort and motivation for the whole team. And because some of us have classes
and plans, usually we meet on the weekends. We could address our project and
our activities very well in those moments. We also gathered ourselves in the
school campus after lecture and tutorial classes to discuss and decide what
topic or what project we will be doing. For instance, at first, everyone had
different ideas for this project, Kieu Anh got an idea for a data lake, Phong
had an idea for a shopping online application, and Bao had an idea for a VPN
application. But overall, we ended up with the idea of a Micro Bit which was
found by Phat. The reason why we choose this idea because Kieu Anh’s idea was
quite complicated to implement due to lack of knowledge, Phong’s project is kind
of similar to the existed shopping application since there is only one
out-standing feature, and Bao’s idea could be the most difficult one to do
because it requires many software skills.&nbsp;<br>
                      <br>Furthermore, we also set a team
deadline and divide tasks and for each member for this project: Phong and Phat
are mainly in charge of game development, Kieu Anh is responsible for the web
development, Bao and Thu mainly write the report. But it is not only that a
member only does their given task but everyone in the team also contributes and
helps others if needed.
We
communicate through face-to-face and virtual environments, i.e., the internet.
We wouldn't just meet at a café, we would chat through other virtual resources
such as Messenger, Discord or just email or use Facebook. This is to avoid that
a person is busy and not able to attend a group meeting.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

for our project because it can help us detects any problems for our project. To
perform the test, we need one user to play the game. The user can be anyone but
will prefer those who have experience with micro bit and playing video games.
The user will try to test all of the functions or keys available in the game.
This project will be successful if the code can compile without having any
glitches, bugs, or issues. The IO extender can connect to the Microbit and the
computer. The LED lights and the sound need to be work. After performing many tests,
we can fix many errors in our project.</p>
