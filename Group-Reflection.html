                <span class="u-custom-font u-font-georgia">&nbsp;the four weeks of working together, my team has made good progress and the group's performance has also improved a lot. The group's communication has improved very well compared to the first weeks. People open and begin to discuss more, contribute ideas to each other, and understand the team's project. Most people are present in the group meetings, in case we cannot meet, we would call each other to exchange more information with project. Besides, my team did a great job in connecting the members, so we accomplished this project well as well as understand more about the members. During the project, we have a few things that have not been done well and can be improved on time as the team deadline and better understand the project. According to the plan, the group will set a deadline for the group to help the group complete the plan on time. For some reason, the team was not able to finish the work&nbsp;</span>
                <span class="u-custom-font u-font-georgia">according to the schedule of the plan, we tried to fix it in the final weeks as well as improve in the future. Our group has encountered a situation in which we misread the topic and shorten the time. After not understanding the lesson, we moved to the lecture to explain and understand the best thing to do. The surprising thing about our group is that everyone is very friendly and supportive. Even if they are not responsible for the other part, they will assist someone if needed. After completing the project, we learned to take responsibility for the assigned task and pay special attention to the timing of the assignment. Moreover, we know that we need to exchange ideas with our team members and follow our plan. GitHub is a useful tool for backing up code components. We were able to look at the components code together and fix it if needed. Working activities on GitHub are saved to help us know the team's productivity.</span>

              <span class="u-custom-font u-font-georgia">We started our project since week 9 so it has been 4 weeks. Personally, I think that everything went well, especially, how we divided tasks for each member of the team. Everyone feels comfortable with their given task and one more thing that I love is communication between people. Unlike teams that I used to work with in high school, I feel my team is very responsible and professional. We set a deadline, sit and work together so when I am struggling with something, others are extremely welcome to help, contribute or give some advice for me. One thing that I think could be improved is our Micro: bit game, if everyone has known and explored more about it then our game would be much more interesting or even become the best game of the class in this course. After working with my teammates, I have learned how I should be in a group project. This partly helps me in the future when working in a professional environment such as a company. In order to achieve the goal, it is not just basically the idea of the project, on the other hand, the responsibility and communication also play an extremely important role. For the audit trail part, GitHub helps me to report our works, our contribution to the project.</span>

All the goals, deadlines for each week were achieved. All the members equally contribute well to the project. We usually have meetings so that all the members can get along with others, communicate well so we always have a positive team environment. If we have more time, we could have developed more on the gameplay and also make the game more challenging and interesting. I have never worked in a group in a professional and have a responsible teammate like this, unlike when I work with my team in high school. We usually have a meeting, study together and everyone helps each other when someone struggles with anything. With the audit trail part, GitHub helps me keeping track all the change has been push to the repository so when someone in my group change anything, I can see those changes.</span>

Each member has their own duties and each of them has completed quite well their duties. Our project is now complete, and we will add more effects and the sound quality will be improved. After developing the project, we learn more about a simple technical meanwhile, through the process of searching for and developing Microbit, all members improve their technical skills more. After 4 weeks of working as a whole group, our communication has improved a lot, everyone freely discusses as well as contributes personal ideas to help the team project complete the best. When people need to sit together doing homework, everyone takes time for meetings and is also responsible for accomplishing all the goals set by the group. Besides, everyone is very professional in teamwork and problem solving in projects. During the time of the project we use GitHub to store and create our code so that we can easily checking the code with each other. I think GitHub has helped our project finished faster because it saves us a lot of time so that we can manage to improve the product. My part on the tool is making the function of the game then everyone can show their opinion if they want to add or remove any function. While working with my team, I learned how to decide the tasks for each member, better communication will help in the future. Meanwhile, I have more responsibility and improved communication with everyone in the group.</span>

We usually call for meeting and everyone was on time, the process of learning a new thing was not easy because most of us did not know about micro bit but now we all have the basic knowledge about it, everyone was enthusiastic to make this project. Of course, there were some problems during the time working with the micro bits since we lacked knowledge about debugging skill however we managed to fix it. Overall, our process work smoothly however there are some problems we need to improve. The first thing is our concentration, we usually get off topic when during the process. Secondly, we seem to get lazy easily when something went difficult, we usually leave that to tomorrow leading our project took more time than other team; however, when we got lazy, we were more creative when think of new idea to improve our project since I want my teammates to submit the code that was made before then we came up with a new idea which help our product more attractive. After four weeks working in this group, I have learned how to become more responsibility since we have a rule that everyone needs to be on time in the meeting and need to compete their task before a specific time.</span>

              <span class="u-custom-font u-font-georgia" style="font-size: 1.125rem;">The last four weeks has us changed a lot not just in how we work as individual but also how we can share one’s point of view and utilize it in an effective way. We have been working together well. We knew and took care of each of our strengths. Together, we made sure to show each of our strengths, not letting any get by us. One very positive aspect of this project was that we were able to build an actual game model though our own individual connections and make sure that this was owned by the whole community. As a team, we did not grasp the scope of the issue and took a concentrated approach. We found that we were too focused on reports which were hard to address when a lot easier and faster gains could have been made in adding additional Microbit functions by considering a wider range of triggers for delayed discharges. The principal point of learning is not to jump into the challenge and to spend some time thoroughly analyzing the problem. In retrospect, we should have invited others to join the team and we would have been able to fasten the project by defining what part need to be focus on. We also thought automatically that the problem was much more complicated than it was. For the audit trail part, GitHub helps me to document all my activities and I can even identify my codes by myself separately, which is very handy. From my view, I see myself good at connecting all the members during sharing meeting and contribute different view on a subject.</span>
