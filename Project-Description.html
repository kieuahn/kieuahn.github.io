              <span class="u-custom-font u-font-georgia">The project is about developing a simple Star Wars game displayed on the Microbit board and from that investigate its usefulness in the context of Vietnam’s high school’s Technology Education as a solution to address Vietnam education gaps in Computer Science together with advancing the understanding in its teaching pattern in Vietnam to select the best option.</span>

              <span class="u-custom-font u-font-georgia">Putting it in a simple term, the project systematically reviews the data for tracking current shortcomings in Technology Education in Vietnam’s high schools, aiming to provide a basic Microbit game as a device for a high school student to both entertain and learn. Understanding the link between it and student learning style preference when studying Computer Science generates fresh insight into an efficient method that teaches students to be active learners. &nbsp;</span>
            </span>

          <p style="text-align: justify;">
            <span class="u-custom-font u-font-georgia" style="font-size: 1.125rem;">From since to then, the East Asian community is renowned for its intellectual accomplishments, and we see no difference here in Vietnam. The idea of the project was initialized based on the reflection of the on-going short-coming in the education system. Many primary and secondary schools in remote mountainous areas lack basic infrastructure, such as classrooms, labs, libraries, and the storage of educational equipment, limiting the student to improve essential hard skills, especially if inclining to IT career. It is no exception for the urban area, even though typical teaching aids are provided, now it is the school curriculum that restrains the student development progress due to lack of engagement with the subject but more in textbooks and school matters. That is why we choose Microbit as a representative tool not only as an effective way to learn to code but also familiar the students with basic robotics. This Star Wars game aims for student experience and, also acts as a model that introduce students to new technologies with which they connect every day and inspire them not only to be technology users but also to be solution developers by training them for their first careers in technology. From the game, a student can learn to build Microbit devices or prototypes, which is a well-rounded practice that teaches students technological skills such as dealing with materials and electronics, prototyping, measuring, and coding by having active and hands-on experiences. Using low cost and publicly available components, students can easily create several models or adjust their designs based on customer input.</span>

            <span class="u-custom-font u-font-georgia" style="font-size: 1.125rem;">We must admit that it is somewhat by accident that we have interested in the Microbit. Most of us barely know about BBC Microbit before but when we first expose to this kind of new technology, we were all intrigued by the idea of its usage as well as how it operates and then decided to have the training session about Microbit. Having trained, we found that the more we have ourselves educated about it, the more we find ourselves driven towards the field. The main motivation comes from our thirst for exploring new ideas and method to become proficient in a field, for us it is our kind of things, we saw it as an opportunity to expand our apprehension along with practice one's both soft skill and hard skill. While our love of learning new things brought us into this project, it is the thought of proposing what we can do to improve the existing shortage of Vietnam Computer Science education that kept us here. Certainly, the project is not entirely feasible but working on it with the positive belief that “we will not know if we do not try” makes us feel good, and it motivates us to do great things ourselves at either the Vietnam education or work, home, or in our communities.</span>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">
            <span style="font-size: 1.125rem;">
              <span class="u-custom-font u-font-georgia">In fact, technology is now progressing at such a rapid speed, allowing quicker change and growth, creating an increase in the rate of change, until it can gradually become exponential. Consequently, emerging IT trends such as AI, VR, AR, Machine Learning and so on, are gradually proliferated and becomes more essential in the ongoing world. For that to happen, Microbit serves its function as a fundamental of which beginners when entering the field can make use, to familiar themselves with three coding languages, namely, Python, JavaScript and Blocks, and acquire basics of electronics whilst tinkering with the Microbit board.</span>
            </span>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">
            <span style="font-size: 1.125rem;">
              <span class="u-custom-font u-font-georgia">Having said that, it’s always simpler to see what the learnings are after a project has been done, and now I know what I would do differently the next time. We get to learn how to program a Microbit that allows us to understand how to code and empowers individual to have complete control over the functionality of the Microbit. This improves our soft skills like Computational Thinking, attention to detail, creativity, problem solving and teamwork as well as a well-rounded activity which teaches us technical skills like electronics, prototyping, testing, and coding. Creating a product or working prototype also involves cooperation between a variety of people with different skills and working styles, each member of the team must choose a particular responsibility, settle on the deadline, discuss progress with the members of the team and learn from each other. What is more, using Microbit to build tools lets us develop useful, real-world industrial prototyping and testing skills. All the skills and traits mentioned above are crucial aspects the many recruiter is finding these days in the employees and we believe developing this project will help us to achieve this goal.</span>

We acknowledge that there are also lots of products displaying similar function like that of ours, namely, Rasperry Pi 3, BeagleBone Black, Udoo Quad, C.H.I.P, Arduino INDUSTRIAL 101, Ras Pad and so on. In general, therefore, it seems that Rasperry Pi Zero has most similarities with our device so we would focus on demonstrating the differences between Rasperry Pi function and that of our device.</span>

A micro controller doesn't have an interface, you write a program to a computer, and you just upload the code to the monitor. So, rather than promoting similarities, we ought to look at the expected application of each system to see which one suits best.</span>
