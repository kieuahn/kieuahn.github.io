                  <p class="u-align-justify u-custom-font u-font-georgia u-text u-text-3">In the web design and Micro: bit
setup, everyone discussed and made the idea to choose a simple game to set up
the Micro: bit. Phat will be the code writer for the game, Bao will adjust the
game's sound effects. Meanwhile, Thu and Kieu Anh will create the web and put
the code on the GitHub so that members can edit, while Phong will design the
interface for the web. After that, Phat will run the test, check for errors and
the wire is connected; besides, Phong will check whether the java scripts are
working properly. The group's implementation went well, the Microbit tool we
were lent by a friend of Phat. We plan to connect the audio to the speakers so
that there will be better quality sound.&nbsp;<br>
                    <br>In week 9, we formed a group with 5
members and started to choose a topic for our project. While discussing about
the project, we decided what part of the report and the project should each
member have to do.&nbsp;For week 10, each member was assigned two to three parts of
the report to write, and everyone has the task of checking the overall report. Phat
will be responsible Tools and Technologies, Risks and Tools, Kieu Anh writes
Project Description and Overview; Thu will talk about Aim, Roles, Plan and
Progress, while Phong describes and explains Scope and Limit, Group Progress
and Communications, and Bao talking about Testing, Skill and Jobs. After all
the individual have finished writing, the report will be posted to SharePoint
for members to discuss and edit by other members. When editing is complete,
Kieu Anh will format parts such as Cover Page, Table Content, and check the
font. In the details of the report, the Team Profile and Timeframe for the
whole team will work together because everyone needs to set a reasonable time
for the team to work. During week 11, we conducted the presentation designing,
website editing and the Microbit performance testing. Phat is a game
development and he is also manager of the Microbit. So, he will the code writer
for the game and control the sound when it possible run the game according to
the lines of the code in the computer he has programmed. Kieu Anh is a web
development, she chose a website template based on the information of the
report. Besides, she designed a web interface appropriate to the concept
project and put the code on the GitHub so that members can edit. Meanwhile, Bao
picked a template for the presentation and Thu designed background for each
slide in the PowerPoint. After that, Phong added the main information from the
report to each slide, while he helped Kieu Anh to design the interface for the
web and supported Phat to develop the game effect. In week 12 that is last
week, we prepare scripts and start rehearsing for presentation, while the
report and the website were supposed to completing, the game will be complete
and without any technical errors during execution.&nbsp;<br>
                    <br>While we were choosing a project for
the team, Phat came up with developing Microbit game because he is quite good
at how Microbit works and encoding. After researching and reading online
articles, the primary students in Europe are learning about simple technology
like Microbit. Although technology equipment in Vietnam is very developed, for
the children in primary school, they have not been exposed much to technology
devices during school hours. So, our team decided to choose Microbit for our
project. We choose Microbit for the project because we want to convey the
message that this technology device is easy to use and that our children in our
country can have access to more technology equipment in the coming years.&nbsp;<br>
                    <br>According to the plan, we will
complete some parts like feedback and reflection at the end of the week as
these are general parts of the project. We listened to and gathered information
from your class comments at the end of the tutorial. Currently, we've been
creating a pretty good sound effect, and we'll try to create a different sound
for the game.

create a space shooting game by using Microbit. There are many goals to achieve
this aim.&nbsp;<br>
                    <br>The game goals are very important in
game because it is what we strive for. By having a goal, player can determine
how to win the game. In this space shooting game, the main goal to win the game
is to kill as many enemies as possible within a certain timeframe. By the end
of the time, player will know how much score he has. After having the goal,
player need to have a strategy to achieve the goal by killing the enemies.&nbsp;<br>
                    <br>All the functions in Microbit work
well together is another major target. The Microbit must be linked with the
device successfully, the IO Extender will be connected to the Microbit. Both
LED lights function well to reveal simple enemy blocks, "Game Over"
text, score...The sound of the game needs to be melodious and enjoyable. All
the buttons on Microbit can work well. On the coding part, all of the four main
functions: “all-star” function, “forever” function, “crash” function and “on
press button A” can compile without any bugs or issues. The website also can be
accessed.
